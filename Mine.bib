  abstract      = {Abstract The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to investigate the flexural behaviour of concrete filled steel tube (CFST) columns of circular cross-section, made with rubberized concrete (RuC). A second objective is to identify behavioural differences between this type of composite members and typical CFST members made with standard concrete (StdC), namely in terms of the influence of the rubber aggregate replacement ratio on member strength, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity. The paper describes the preparation and development of an experimental campaign, involving the testing of 16 circular specimens, 12 RuCFST and 4 StdCFST. The definition of the test campaign considered a number of parameters, namely cross-section slenderness, aggregate replacement ratio, axial load level and loading type. A special device was developed as part of an innovative testing setup, aimed at reducing both the cost and preparation time of the specimens. This paper also describes the comparison of the test results with design provisions from Eurocode 4. The test results show a marginal influence of the type of concrete infill on the monotonic and cyclic behaviour of the members and also allow concluding that Eurocode 4 is conservative in predicting the capacity of the tested specimens. Moreover, it is found that the cross-section slenderness does not have a significant influence on the monotonic and cyclic behaviour of the specimens, pointing out for the possible relaxation of the cross-section slenderness limits currently specified in Eurocodes 4 and 8.},

  abstract        = {The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to study the bending behaviour of Concrete Filled Steel Tube (CFST) columns made with Rubberized Concrete (RuC), and to assess the seismic performance of moment-resisting frames with these structural members. The paper describes an experimental campaign where a total of 36 specimens were tested, resorting to a novel testing setup, aimed at reducing both the preparation time and cost of the test specimens. Different geometrical and material parameters were considered, namely cross-section type, cross-section slenderness, aggregate replacement ratio, axial load level and lateral loading type. The members were tested under both monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, with different levels of applied axial loading. The test results show that the bending behaviour of CFST elements is highly dependent on the steel tube properties and that the type of infill does not have a significant influence on the flexural behaviour of the member. It is also found that Eurocode 4 is conservative in predicting the flexural capacity of the tested specimens. Additionally, it was found that the seismic design of composite momentresisting frames with CFST columns, according to Eurocode 8, not only leads to lighter design solutions but also to enhanced seismic performance in comparison to steel frames. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on the characterization of the behaviour of Concrete Filled Steel Tubular (CFST) columns made with Rubberized Concrete (RuC), and on the development of an accurate numerical model for the simulation of CFST columns under monotonic and cyclic bending. The test campaign involves 18 CFST specimens with different configurations, namely the cross-section slenderness, the concrete strength, the axial load level and the lateral loading type. All CFST members tested exhibited good ductility under monotonic loading. The Eurocode 4 design provisions was verified against the test results and the design capacities of the CFST members were validated to be conservative. A comprehensive 3D Finite Element (FE) model was developed and calibrated based on test results. The FE model proved to be reliable in predicting the bending behaviour of CFST member, in terms of local buckling deformation modes, ultimate capacity and ductility of the CFST columns.},
